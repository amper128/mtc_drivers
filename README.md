Researching kernel for KLD on RK3188.

It seems that the kernel assembly is based on the source code of RK3188 SDK,
in particular, there are many matches with mach-rk3188/board-rk3188-sdk.c.
Obviously, the developers have created a new device, but I think that now
it is reasonable to take these source codes as a basis.
